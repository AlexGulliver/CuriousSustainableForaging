# Using Curious Agents to optimise the Sustainable Foraging Problem
This is my final year BSc Computer Science project investigating whether 'curious' reinforcement learning agents can be used to optimise the sustainable foraging problem.

## Background

### The Sustainable Foraging Problem

For information on the Sustainable Foraging problem see:

### What is Curiosity?
Curiosity in Reinforcement Learning is a method to supplement agents with intrinsically sourced reward feedback to boost their learning, particularly in sparse-reward environments. 

The reward signal provided by a curiosity module is informed by a prediction error of the next state.
