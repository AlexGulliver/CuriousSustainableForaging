# Curious Sustainable Foraging
This project investigates whether 'curious' reinforcement learning agents can be used to optimise the sustainable foraging problem.

## What is Curiosity?
Curiosity in Reinforcement Learning is a method to supplement agents with intrinsically sourced reward feedback to boost their learning, particularly in sparse-reward environments. 

The reward signal provided by a curiosity module is informed by a prediction error of the next state.
